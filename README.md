`pnpm install` rebilds all native modules

`pnpm dev` run with hot reload for the frontend

`pnpm run build` compiles both main (tsc) and renderer (Vite)

`pnpm run lint` checks for errors

`pnpm run release` build for the current platform. To cross-compile (e.g., build Windows from Linux), you'd pass `--win` / `--mac` / `--linux` flags: `pnpm run release -- --win`

### WTF is this [Source-Available Non-Redistribution License](LICENSE.MD)?

It should be pretty clear and short enough. Basically it allows you to use as helper in your art jorney for free, but disallows selling software itself. You should still be able to use it in your art commisions or studies and don't have to mention software on art itself or in art description.  

Basically my only goal was to restricts some "_smart_" people of swapping logo\name on it and trying to sell it like they created it.

I have no plans on making core functionality pay-to-use or include ads. I may or may not later on add some functionallity that requires remote server, like notifications, achievments or study leaderboards and servers usually aren't free to run.

I have no plans on adding any hidden tracking or usage metrics without prior consent. (don't you all love the dashboards to see how much time you've spend learning compared to playing games or watching tv?).
